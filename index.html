<p>The main purposes of this analysis are to summarize the characteristics of variables that can affect the loan status and to get some ideas about the relationships among variables.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is a form of online micro-financing that has been growing as an alternative to traditional credit financing. P2P lending allows individuals to lend or borrow directly from each other without financial intermediaries, through an internet based platform</p>
<h2 id="understanding-the-dataset">Understanding the Dataset</h2>
<p>The Dataset is from Bondora, a P2P lending platform in Europe. The retrieved data is a pool of both defaulted and non-defaulted loans from the time period between 1st March 2009 and 27th January 2020. The data comprises of demographic and financial information of borrowers, and loan transactions. The total is 134, 000 loan application with 112 variables.</p>

<h2 id="data-pre-processing">Data Pre-processing</h2>
<p>The data is pre-processed by removing the variables that are not relevant to the analysis, and by dealing with missing values. for the missing values, the variables with more than 40% missing values are removed, and the rest are imputed by the mean or mode value of the variable.</p>
<p><img src="images/missing_values.webp" alt="Missing Values"></p>
<p>Then for categorical variables, we removed the irrelevant values that could happen during the data collection process, and then try to prepare the data to be used in the analysis with higher integrity and correctness.</p>
<p>In addition, the Default Status variable was defined in this process where we created a column for the default status of each loan application. The default status is defined as 1 if the loan is defaulted, and 0 if the loan is not defaulted.</p>
<p>The shape of the dataset after pre-processing is <strong>(77394, 42)</strong> including the target variable which is Default Status.</p>
<h2 id="exploratory-data-analysis-eda">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
<p>The EDA is done to understand the data and to get some ideas about the relationships among variables. The EDA is done by using the univariate and bivariate analysis. The univariate analysis is done by using the descriptive statistics and the visualization. The bivariate analysis is done by using the visualization.</p>
<p>We found many correlation between the variables and tried to identify and visualize the relationships among variables. The relationships are visualized by using the scatter plot, box plot, and bar plot.</p>
<p>All the insights and findings from the EDA can be found in the file the EDA NoteBook.</p>
<p>These are some of the insights and findings from the EDA:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Gender Distribution in the dataset is <strong>66% Male</strong> and <strong>34% Female</strong>.</li>
<li>The Age Distribution in the dataset is <strong>68% between 25 and 44 years old</strong>.</li>
<li>check the following plots for more insights about the Age and Gender Distribution in the dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/Gender_Default_count.webp" alt="Gender_Default">
<img src="images/Age_Default.webp" alt="Age_Default"></p>
<h2 id="feature-engineering-and-selection">Feature Engineering and Selection</h2>
<p>The feature engineering and selection is done to prepare the data for the machine learning model. The feature engineering is done by removing the outliers in the dataset and by applying the method of Mutual Information to select the most relevant features. Then according to the results of EDA we tested some new variables that could be useful for the analysis. and finally we applied the method of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data.</p>
<p>The feature engineering and selection is done by using the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mutual Information (MI) and the result is as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p>For Category Variables:
<img src="images/MI_cat.webp" alt="MI"></p>
<p>For Numeric Variables:
<img src="images/MI_num.webp" alt="MI"></p>
<ul>
<li>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the explained variance is as follows:
<img src="images/PCA.webp" alt="PCA"></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="machine-learning-model">Machine Learning Model</h2>
<h3 id="classification-model">Classification Model</h3>
<p>The first target variable is the Default Status, which is a binary variable. The classification model is used to predict the Default Status of the loan application. The classification model is done by using the Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. All models were evaluated by using the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and confusion matrix. Then we selected the best model with the highest accuracy and applied the model to the test data.</p>
<p>The selected model was: <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> with the accuracy of <strong>88.57 %</strong></p>
<h3 id="regression-model">Regression Model</h3>
<p>As part of the credit risk analysis, predicting the default state of the loan is just one part of the analysis. There are other factors that the credit risk depends on. In our analysis, we created the target variables that has an impact on the credit score. These Targets are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI)</li>
<li>Eligible Loan Amount (ELA)</li>
<li>Preferred Rate of Interest (PROI)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we create a model to predict these targets using Regression Model. The regression model is done by using the Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. All models were evaluated by using the R2 score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Then we selected the best model with the highest R2 score and applied the model to the test data.</p>
<p>The selected model was: <strong>Ridge Regression</strong> with the R2 score of <strong>89.07 %</strong></p>
<h2 id="pipeline">Pipeline</h2>
<p>The pipeline is done by using the Pipeline from sklearn. The pipeline is done by using the Standard Scaler, PCA, and the selected model. The pipeline is done for both classification and regression model.</p>
<p>The pipeline for the classification model is as follows:
<img src="images/classification.webp" alt="Model"></p>
<p>The pipeline for the regression model is as follows:
<img src="images/regression.webp" alt="Model"></p>
<p>These pipelines are used to predict the Default Status, EMI, ELA, and PROI. They were deployed in the web application using the Flask framework with pickle to save the model.</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>The deployment is done by using the Flask framework. The web application is deployed in the Heroku platform. The web application is done by using the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The web application is done by using the Bootstrap framework. The web application is done by using the Flask framework with pickle to save the model.</p>
<p>There are two pages in the web application:</p>
<ul>
<li>One page to let the user enter the required data to predict the Default Status, EMI, ELA, and PROI.</li>
<li>The other page to show the result of the prediction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the link to the web application: <a href="https://magnificent-kheer-e9717e.netlify.app/">Deployment Link/</a>
Here is a screenshot of the web application:
<img src="images/Web_app1.webp" alt="Web">
<img src="images/web_app2.webp" alt="Web"></p>
<h2 id="result-and-conclusion">Result and Conclusion</h2>
<p>The final result is a web application that predicts the parameters required to calculate the credit score of a given loan application and investors can use this web application to predict the credit score of a loan application before investing in it, this will help investors to make a better decision and to reduce the risk of investing in a loan application that will be defaulted.</p>
